## **Problem**
A new client heard about the work we did on ULEMHub and recommended us to this music company, Spotify — they want us to implement their new UI design in TailwindCSS.

They want an exact copy of what the UI/X engineer designed for these 3 screens:

Home Screen
Playlist
Playlist Details

### **Method**
We discussed git workflow and what we needed to do to start the project. I decided to break down the main components such as the side bar footer music player and the the colors for the projects for the projects so that it could be consistent with all the rest of the client’s website.



## **Process**
PHPStorm, git hub.com, zoom, Tailwindcss

## **Result+Demo**

I created the home screen layout ,side bar, main body content which includes the music /image selection.


I will discuss on demo day  the design layout and the method I use to create the home screen, I will also talk about using flex and grids with tailwindcss.
