# Contribution to the solution:

I used Jira to track what I needed to do for the project, I broke them into sections. I started with creating the html anf Tailwind css for page #1
then, I started working to page # 2. I then gathered the icons, and logo, for both of the pages.
I then started to work on the javascript. I figured out the solution to have the user click on the login button on page #1, then to them to page # 2.
In addition, when the user inputs their username  the javascript solution would require that the input to be at least 6 characters or more, otherwise prompting an error.
Furthermore,when the user inputs a password it had to be greater than 8 character and have one number otherwise prompting an error.
When the both conditions were meant the user could proceed to the Spotify.com homepage.
